These words are typically filtered out or removed during text analysis tasks, such as sentiment analysis, to focus on more important and meaningful words. Examples of stopwords in English include articles (e.g., \"a\", \"an\", \"the\"), pronouns (e.g., \"I\", \"you\", \"he\", \"she\"), prepositions (e.g., \"in\", \"on\", \"at\"), and conjunctions (e.g., \"and\", \"but\", \"or\"). By removing stopwords, text analysis algorithms can often improve efficiency and accuracy by eliminating noise and reducing the dimensionality of the data."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":23,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":347,"status":"ok","timestamp":1688204791892,"user":{"displayName":"Amusa Abdulahi tomisin","userId":"03487879578032455069"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"YQ3TfEr46oxo"},"outputs":[],"source":["from gensim.parsing.preprocessing import remove_stopwords"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2GqYSxkoCOxJ"},"source":["#### Lowercasing"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":24,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":346,"status":"ok","timestamp":1688204791892,"user":{"displayName":"Amusa Abdulahi tomisin","userId":"03487879578032455069"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"_uGm73TMjRCO","outputId":"33ae0514-e68d-4009-9c2e-adff6941520b"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":[" i think we have it pretty much figured out.  added a box in the helsinki group where you can see the tweets\n"]}],"source":["sample_text = df_train.text[1020]\n","sample_text = sample_text.lower()\n","print(sample_text)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":25,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":311,"status":"ok","timestamp":1688204791893,"user":{"displayName":"Amusa Abdulahi tomisin","userId":"03487879578032455069"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"FKofXGq-6ofm","outputId":"4e7f2d6d-205a-4bbf-c1bf-b6ed3985030b"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["think pretty figured out. added box helsinki group tweets\n"]}],"source":["## NB: Remember to convert the text into their lowercase form so that for example \"I\" will be exactly the same as \"i\"\n","new_words = remove_stopwords(sample_text)\n","print(new_words)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":29,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":290,"status":"ok","timestamp":1688204791894,"user":{"displayName":"Amusa Abdulahi tomisin","userId":"03487879578032455069"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"TKsruNXF5EEO"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Jokheny7BLhw"},"source":["#### Removing Special character, mentions, hashtags"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":26,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":290,"status":"ok","timestamp":1688204791895,"user":{"displayName":"Amusa Abdulahi tomisin","userId":"03487879578032455069"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"pmZjGpkR47E8"},"outputs":[],"source":["\n","text = \"Great article!
